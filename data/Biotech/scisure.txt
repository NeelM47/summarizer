Biotech R&D has birthed some of the most impressive innovations, from recombinant DNA to genome editing. While the road to commercialization has always been challenging, many fundamental barriers to innovation have grown bigger. Currently, there’s an overload of unstructured data and ideas. Translating these into world-changing ideas presents a huge organizational and logistical challenge.

With the rise of generative AI in the past year, a solution to some of these issues is on the horizon. Generative AI can promote divergent thinking, challenge the bias of experts, evaluate and refine ideas, and facilitate collaboration across niche research areas. It’s also streamlining the data lifecycle and changing the creative aspects of biotech lab operations, such as automating and improving the quality of content, from lab notebooks to published scientific literature. 

In the following blog, we look at what generative AI is, how it works, and its applications in biotech and the broader life sciences.

What is Generative AI? 
Generative AI, or Gen AI, is a class of artificial intelligence techniques and algorithms that generate new data samples or content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos. 

Unlike discriminative models that focus on classification or prediction tasks based on existing data, generative models learn the underlying patterns and structures of the data to generate new instances that are statistically similar to the training data.

Gen AI Encompasses a Wide Range of Algorithms and Approaches
Gen AI has applications across various domains, including image generation, text synthesis, music composition, drug discovery, and content creation. It enables the generation of realistic and diverse data samples, facilitates data augmentation for training machine learning models, and fosters creativity and innovation in AI-driven applications.

There are several algorithms and approaches, including:

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner. The generator learns to generate realistic data samples, such as images, text, or audio, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and generated samples. Through adversarial training, GANs produce high-quality synthetic data that closely resembles the distribution of real data.
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): VAEs are probabilistic generative models that learn to encode and decode data samples into a lower-dimensional latent space. By sampling from the latent space and decoding the samples back into the original data space, VAEs can generate new data samples that capture the variability and structure of the training data. VAEs are commonly used for generating images, text, and other complex data types.
Autoregressive Models: AutoRegressive models, such as autoregressive neural networks (ARNs) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models, generate data sequences by modeling the conditional probability distribution of each data point given the previous observations. By iterative sampling from the conditional distribution, autoregressive models generate sequences of data samples, such as time series data, speech, or text.
Transformers: Transformers are a class of deep learning architectures that have achieved state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Transformers, particularly variants like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), can generate coherent and contextually relevant text by modeling the relationships between words or tokens in a sequence.
How Does Gen AI Work?
Gen AI uses various techniques – including neural networks and deep learning algorithms – to identify patterns and generate new outcomes based on them. The training process for a generative model involves feeding it a large dataset of examples, such as images, text, audio, and videos. While traditional AI aims to perform specific tasks based on predefined rules and patterns, gen AI goes beyond this limitation and strives to create entirely new data that resembles human-created content. A language model is an example of gen AI, using a probabilistic model of a natural language that can generate probabilities of a series of words based on text corpora in one or multiple languages it was trained on. Large language models, in their most advanced form, are a combination of feedforward neural networks and transformers.

In the area of natural language processing, there is also a neural network, a method in artificial intelligence that teaches computers to process data in a way inspired by the human brain. Deep learning is a type of machine learning process that uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that resembles the human brain. These algorithms can take different data inputs and be used for speech and voice recognition.
