One Controller for Many Robots
PackBot 510 is controlled by the uPoint® Multi-Robot Control System, featuring a touchscreen-based ruggedized tablet that allows an operator to select from across the family of connected robots. The familiarity of this Android™-based controller results in a significantly reduced learning curve for robot operators. uPoint also benefits from superior wireless communications. The MPU5 radio operating on the Wave Relay® MANET, allows robots to penetrate deeper into complex structures and further downrange than ever before.
