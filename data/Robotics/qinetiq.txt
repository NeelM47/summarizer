Multi-Mission Explosive Ordnance Disposal Robot
TALON Medium-Sized Tactical Robot
Since its introduction in 2000, QinetiQ's TALON® family of robots have earned a reputation for durability, flexibility, reliability and performance in keeping personnel, assets and civilians out of harm’s way. 

In military, law enforcement and first responder applications, TALONs are widely deployed for improvised explosive device (IED) and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), reconnaissance, communications, CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear), HAZMAT, security, heavy lift, defense and rescue missions. Our TALON CBRN/Hazmat modular kit is available for TALON IV and V models.

TALONs have been used worldwide, from Ground Zero after the 2001 World Trade Center attack, to IRAQ and Afghanistan, searching for the Boston Marathon bombing suspect and assisting with security during major sporting events.

TALON V is the first Interoperability Profile (IOP) fielded robotic system to have successfully gone through Army Test and Evaluation Command testing.

Now on its sixth generation, TALON VI updates QinetiQ's proven and trusted EOD robot for a new era.
