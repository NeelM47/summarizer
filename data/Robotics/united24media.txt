China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has conducted live-fire drills involving four-legged robotic platforms equipped with automatic rifles, according to reports from state broadcaster CCTV-7.

The exercises were carried out by units of the PLA’s 76th Group Army in a mountainous area of northern China, not far from the Russian border.

Footage released by the broadcaster shows the robotic systems—resembling mechanical dogs—integrated into infantry operations and advancing across uneven terrain while providing covering fire.

According to Defense Blog on July 14, the exercise marks one of the most public demonstrations of China’s growing use of robotic ground platforms in tactical scenarios.

A PLA instructor featured in the broadcast explained that the robots are designed to supplement ground troops in areas where human soldiers face heightened risk.

“These robotic systems can follow soldiers across complex terrain and provide firepower where human troops are most vulnerable,” the officer stated.

The systems demonstrated capabilities such as obstacle avoidance, remote communication with human operators, and target engagement in close-quarters scenarios. In the televised footage, PLA soldiers are seen maneuvering while robotic units crawl forward and engage simulated enemy positions with rifles mounted on their backs.

PLA officials said the platforms are being evaluated for roles including reconnaissance, suppression of enemy positions, and urban combat support. The robotic systems were also tested alongside small tactical drones, which provided aerial surveillance and relayed targeting information to ground forces.

Chinese defense analysts cited in the report described the drills as part of a broader shift in PLA operational doctrine, with an increased focus on unmanned systems and networked combat. The integration of air and ground robotics is intended to enhance situational awareness and operational efficiency in contested environments.

The exact location of the exercises was not disclosed, though Chinese media confirmed the drills took place near the country’s northern border. The PLA’s development of such systems follows similar efforts by the United States, Russia, and other militaries to expand the use of autonomous and semi-autonomous technologies in combat scenarios.

Earlier, soldiers from Ukraine’s 28th Separate Mechanized Brigade demonstrated the use of robotic dogs on the front line, employing them for reconnaissance in contested villages. The robots, equipped with sensors and cameras, were used to scout enemy positions and reduce risks during street battles.
