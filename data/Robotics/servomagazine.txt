The BEAR™ — Battlefield Extraction-Assist Robot

The BEAR’s™ patent-pending technology is a marriage of three elements: A powerful upper body controlled by hydraulics; an agile mobility platform that features two independent sets of tracked “legs”; and dynamic balancing behavior. The robot is able to balance itself while on the balls of its “ankles.” In fact, the BEAR can remain upright whether balancing on its ankles, its knees, or even its hips.




The patent-pending BEAR is Vecna Robotics’™ flagship program. Designed to locate, lift and rescue people in harm’s way, the humanoid BEAR can do what humans can’t: lift heavy loads and carry them long distances. Whether on a battlefield, in a mine shaft, near a toxic chemical spill, or inside a structurally-compromised building after an earthquake, the BEAR can rescue those in need without risking additional human life.

The Vecna Robotics™ BEAR project has won key funding from the US Army’s Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC), a part of the US Army Medical Research and Material Command (USAMRMC).
