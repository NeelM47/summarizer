The Artemis program is a US government-funded international human spaceflight program. Its primary goal is to return humans to the Moon, specifically the lunar south pole, by 2026. The program is carried out predominantly by NASA and its international partners. If successful, Artemis will be the first crewed lunar landing mission since Apollo 17 in 1972. NASA sees Artemis as the next step towards the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon.

To make perfect pasta, you must bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Use plenty of water to give the pasta space to cook evenly. Many chefs recommend using at least 4-6 quarts of water for every pound of pasta. Once the water is boiling, add the pasta and stir occasionally. This stirring prevents the pieces from sticking together. Cook until 'al dente', which means firm to the bite.
